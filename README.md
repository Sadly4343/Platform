# Overview

This was a project I decided I wanted to pursue to learn more about game development and how the interaction of C# inside of Unity works with relation to developing a game. I chose this project because it allows me to delve into many different aspects of game development and learn to utilize implementing very similiar scenarios as frontend and backend development of website but in the aspect of creating characters that do things based on scripts created for Unity. I want to gain a deeper understanding of developing steps and working through code that is complex and new to me as a developer and this was the program that I chose.


I chose to develop a 2D Platform game called TileRunner inside of the Unity Game Engine and the game was created to have a main character that could traverse dangerous levels to reach the Trophy at the End of the Level! 
These are the movements:
Space = Jump
Left Movement = Left Key
Right Movement = Right Key
Crouch = C
The game works as a platformer that you progress through the levels to reach the goal and avoid obstacles and enemies with traps throughout the level. 
The game has animations to allow the player to view the different movements of items and enemies as well as the player animations as well.


The purpose for writing this software was that I chose I wanted to delve deeper into an environment with C# and understand how being able to understand the various aspects of OOP programming through Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction. I believe that this project allowed me to do that and gain a better understanding on how I can connect and create software that is designed for the purpose I want it and progress my learning through these projects.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment


The tools that I used to develop this software were:
Unity Game Engine
Virtual Studio Code

The programming language that I decided to use was C# since it is the native language of Unity.
I also used the game design by a free package of sprites and tiles provided here.

# Future Work


* I want to develop this project further and improve the animations and options to do in the game like adding wall holds and double jump as well as ways to deal with enemies.
* I want to reorganize the code to be more efficient and work on improving the overall structure of the level design and increase the number of levels for the game with increased complexity.
* I want to develop further understanding of AI Pathfinding in unity to create more complex enemies that adapt and make the game harder for the player to deal with and more enjoyable in difficulty.
